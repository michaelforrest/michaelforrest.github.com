<p>
  Hello, I am Michael Forrest and I am an artist and programmer based in London, UK. 
</p>
<p>
   I'm always starting things, working hard on them and then abandoning them. This blog is where I declassify some of the projects that have been clogging up my hard drive.

<h2>Finished Things</h2>
<p>Here are a few things I've actually finished. Finishing things is good.</p>

<p><a href="http://goodtohear.co.uk/happiness">Happiness Mood Tracking Journal</a> an app to help people understand themselves better.</p>






<p><a href="http://appstore.com/goodtohear/goodhabits">Good Habits</a> - a very handy app that gets you into the habit of doing things on a daily or weekly basis (such as writing a blog).</p>

<p>These three albums:
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/broken-into-tumbolia/id277733891">Broken Into Tumbolia</a> - a very eclectic one,
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/majectical-electical/id286069118">Majectical Electical</a> - a manic 'up' one and
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/psychogenic-fugue-state/id284446382">Psychogenic Fugue State</a> - a dark, cathartic one.</p>
