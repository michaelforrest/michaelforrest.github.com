Here is something I started a couple of years ago when dubstep still seemed quite cool. 

I was searching for the secret to making those types of musical progressions and came up with this app for interactively toggling and tuning tempo-locked loops. The visual aspect was important to me - I wanted to make sure there was always accurate graphical feedback tightly synchronised to the sound a la [Teenage Engineering OP-1](http://youtu.be/TIS8YWfUvB8). I built this prototype in about a day but then I stalledâ€¦



### What happened?
I needed:

1. graphic design 
1. some decent loops

Also, I'd decided to devote the bulk of my time to completing my [Happiness Mood Tracking Journal App](http://goodtohear.co.uk/happiness) and this app didn't really in with the 'Apps For Life' brand I was developing for *Good To Hear*.


### Has anything changed since then?

I subsequently finished my 'dubstep anthem' *Believe It* so I do have some decent loops for it now.

I had some ideas about the graphic design style too - I'd like to see a grungy pixel art aesthetic referencing areas of London.

I discovered this Mac App [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com/) that would be a good place to figure out some nice dynamic rendering.

### Can it be revived?
Probably. I might rebrand it *Death To Dubstep* or something like that - "the last nail in dubstep's coffin" to make it seem less dated. But it's a very low priority at the moment. 



### Is there any way to help?
I dunno. If you're good at music visualisation or iOS programming you could help me get this finished.
