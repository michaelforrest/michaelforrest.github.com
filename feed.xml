				<title>2. Live DJ Concept</title>
				<description>&lt;h3 id='what_is_it'&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to define a new category of live performance between a band and a DJ. This category would be constituted like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually a single performer&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;live construction of music using loops and drum machines in combination with real instruments and singing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;performances would be dance-floor-friendly, minimising interruptions and pauses to keep people dancing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;music would generally be original based on the performer&amp;#8217;s repertoire of sounds, lyrics and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this video with the idea of establishing this category as a new meme. The music is supposed to show the interesting genre mixing that happens when tempo-locked loops from different sources are layered up together, something I considered would be a recurring theme in my imagined Live DJ scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some footage of my own Live DJ skills&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe class='youtube' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-d2Zbowo3aU'&gt;  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id='what_happened'&gt;What happened?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a lot of artwork and didn&amp;#8217;t really like the style I was creating myself. I got quite impatient with After Effects and started wishing I had a more powerful computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, I just felt the concept was a bit cheesy, or maybe wasn&amp;#8217;t for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='has_anything_changed_since_then'&gt;Has anything changed since then?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real motivation for this project was to get some gigs. I ended up starting my own night &lt;a href='http://goodtohear.co.uk/squares'&gt;Squares&lt;/a&gt; and booking other acts to play alongside instead of pursuing the unrewarding process of emailing promoters asking for gigs (and never getting a response).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been to Ibiza since doing this, which I found quite instructive in understanding people&amp;#8217;s dancefloor expectations where DJs are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='can_it_be_revived'&gt;Can it be revived?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anybody finds this blog post inspiring, sure. I&amp;#8217;m happy to share assets or get involved in any other way if anybody else thinks this concept, or something similar, has legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>1. The Dubstep Machine</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here is something I started a couple of years ago when dubstep still seemed quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was searching for the secret to making those types of musical progressions and came up with this app for interactively toggling and tuning tempo-locked loops. The visual aspect was important to me - I wanted to make sure there was always accurate graphical feedback tightly synchronised to the sound a la &lt;a href='http://youtu.be/TIS8YWfUvB8'&gt;Teenage Engineering OP-1&lt;/a&gt;. I built this prototype in about a day but then I stalledâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='what_happened'&gt;What happened?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;graphic design&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;some decent loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#8217;d decided to devote the bulk of my time to completing my &lt;a href='http://goodtohear.co.uk/happiness'&gt;Happiness Mood Tracking Journal App&lt;/a&gt; and this app didn&amp;#8217;t really in with the &amp;#8216;Apps For Life&amp;#8217; brand I was developing for &lt;em&gt;Good To Hear&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='has_anything_changed_since_then'&gt;Has anything changed since then?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I subsequently finished my &amp;#8216;dubstep anthem&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;Believe It&lt;/em&gt; so I do have some decent loops for it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder='no' height='166' scrolling='no' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F33381290' width='100%'&gt;&lt;!-- KEEP --&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some ideas about the graphic design style too - I&amp;#8217;d like to see a grungy pixel art aesthetic referencing areas of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered this Mac App &lt;a href='http://www.paintcodeapp.com/'&gt;PaintCode&lt;/a&gt; that would be a good place to figure out some nice dynamic rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='can_it_be_revived'&gt;Can it be revived?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably. I might rebrand it &lt;em&gt;Death To Dubstep&lt;/em&gt; or something like that - &amp;#8220;the last nail in dubstep&amp;#8217;s coffin&amp;#8221; to make it seem less dated. But it&amp;#8217;s a very low priority at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='is_there_any_way_to_help'&gt;Is there any way to help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno. If you&amp;#8217;re good at music visualisation or iOS programming you could help me get this finished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
